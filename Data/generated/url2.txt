HEADPHONE JACK: A PLAYLIST YOU SHOULD NOT PLAY DURING SEX

In the heat of the moment, careful with your playlist. Avoid mood-killing songs like 'Crank That' and 'We Didn't Start the Fire'. From Eminem's 'Stan' to Kidz Bop's 'Dance Monkey', be cautious. Keep it sexy with Seal's 'Kiss from a Rose' and Jon Bellion's 'All Time Low'.
