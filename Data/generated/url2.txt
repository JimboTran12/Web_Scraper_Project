HEADPHONE JACK: A PLAYLIST YOU SHOULD NOT PLAY DURING SEX

When creating a sexy playlist, avoid songs like 'Crank That (Soulja Boy)', 'Glimpse of Us', 'Stan', and 'Murder on My Mind'. Stay away from tracks by Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Hudson Mohawke, and more. Keep the vibes right with the right tunes for a passionate playlist.
