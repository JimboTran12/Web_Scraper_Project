WHEN THE SUN GOES DARK: THINGS TO KNOW FOR THE ECLIPSE

If you’re one of the millions of people who have been looking forward to the April 8 solar eclipse, follow this guide to the path of totality.
The period of totality begins at 1:59 p.m. in Carbondale, flanked before and after by a couple hours of partial eclipse — when the moon isn’t completely covering the sun.
The drive to Carbondale is roughly two hours, so be sure to leave enough time in case of traffic backups. Due to the potential traffic jams before and after the eclipse, it is also a good idea to bring plenty of water, food and first aid.
SIUC has teamed up with NASA and Chicago’s Adler Planetarium to host an eclipse viewing at Saluki Stadium. The university requires parking passes to be purchased for those parking on campus.
According to WSIU, cloud cover in Carbondale “reaches at least 60 percent one-third of the time” on April 8. This means there is a decent chance of cloud cover that day, so keep an eye on the weather in the area in the days and hours before the eclipse.
If you are satisfied with seeing just the partial eclipse, there will still be a significant portion of the sun covered up for a few hours in the late morning and early afternoon.
Solar eclipses happen with relative frequency across the world, but they depend on a particular alignment of the Earth, moon and sun to occur.
The April 8 solar eclipse will be the last total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous United States until Aug. 23, 2044.
